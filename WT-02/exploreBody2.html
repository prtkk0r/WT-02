    <h1>Someshwara Temple</h1>
    <h2>Banglore . Karnataka</h2>
    <p>Located in the suburbs of Halasuru (Ulsoor) in Bangalore, Halasuru Someshwara Temple is dedicated to the Hindu
      deity Shiva. Built in around the 12th and the 13th centuries by the Hoysalas, the temple is now managed and
      maintained by the Endowment Department of the Karnataka government. However, major modifications and additions
      to the temple were made during the Vijayanagar empire. The most fascinating are the elaborate sculptures of
      Ravana holding the Kailash Parvat to please Lord Shiva, scenes from
      the wedding of Lord Shiva and Parvati.</p>
